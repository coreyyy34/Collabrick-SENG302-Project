Feature: U24 - As Lei, I want to be able to manage the state of my tasks for a renovation record so that Iâ€™ll be able to
  assign individuals to be responsible for the task.

  Scenario Outline: AC2 - When I am creating a new task I can add a state to the task
    Given a user registers with first name "<first_name>", last name "<last_name>", email "<user_email>", password "<password>", retype password "<password>"
    And a user with email "<user_email>" creates a renovation with title "<title1>", description "<description1>", timestamp "<timestamp1>"
    When a user with email "<user_email>" creates a new task with name "<task_name>" and description "<task_description>" with state "<state>" for renovation "<title1>"
    And a user with email "<user_email>" goes to the individual renovation tasks page of renovation with name "<title1>"
    Then A user with email "<user_email>" has a task for renovation "<title1>" called "<task_name>" with state "<state>"

    Examples:
      | first_name | last_name | user_email            | password       | title1        | description1                 | timestamp1        | task_name         | task_description                | state        |
